Global governance institutions such as the United Nations and the World Bank play vital roles in fostering cooperation, addressing global challenges, and maintaining international peace and security.\n\nInternational relations are constantly evolving, reflecting changes in global power dynamics, emerging technologies, and evolving societal values.
